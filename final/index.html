    <h2 align="middle">Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      In the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton, in an attempt to study the orbits of the planets in our solar system, discovered that his equations of motion weren't able to accurately predict the orbits of our celestial bodies. He discovered that gravitational forces between all the planets would influence their orbits, and thus the n-body problem was born. The n-body problem is an interesting and complex topic that can be used to study the dynamics of heavenly bodies as well as other particle interactions. We were inspired by this problem to create a simulator that models the interaction of particles in space under the influence of gravitational forces. 
    </p>
   


    <h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h3>

    <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>

    <p>
      Our technical approach involves developing a gravity particle simulator that accurately simulates the interactions of particles in a gravitational field. We decided to use Cloth Sim as a skeleton and general architecture for our N-Body Sim because we wanted to make use of the camera, GUI, and renderer methods. To improve the performance when simulating a large number of particles, we used the Barnes-Hut algorithm, which reduces the computational complexity of simulating N-bodies from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N\log{N})$ by grouping particles into an octree. We also added a few new shaders to add visual flair to our particles and improved upon the GUI to add features that allow for dynamically creating different particle configurations, setting simulation speeds, and swapping shaders. 
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Building off of Cloth Sim</h3>

    <p>
      Our first objective was to understand the Cloth Sim pipeline and GUI / program initialization so we could clone a skeleton version of it. This involved reading clothSimulator.h/cpp and main.cpp to understand how the GUI, renderer, and camera were initialized and being used. Once we had a general understanding, we created a new CMAKE project and copied over the code for any relevant methods, removing unused parameters and objects. 
        
      After we got our project to compile, our next objective was to render a few spheres. In Cloth Sim, we don't render any point masses, only the wireframe that's attached to each Spring. For our purposes, we wanted to render particles as spheres, so we used SphereMesh::draw_sphere(), which would render a sphere of specified position and size with a shader applied to it. This ended up being perfect for our use case, so we created a new Particle class that would call this method when Particle::render(GLShader) was called on it. This allowed us to successfully render a few particles on the GUI. 
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Simulation: Newton's Laws and Integration Methods</h3>
    <p>
      In each step of our simulate method, we compute the forces on each particle and then update the position and velocity for every particle.
      Interactions between particles in space are determined by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states: 
      <div style="text-align:center">
        $F = G \dfrac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$
      </div>
      Each particle interacts with every other particle, so if we have $N$ particles, we would have to perform $N(N-1)$ calculations. This works for a small number of particles, but we would need to implement a more effecient solution later.
    </p>
    <p>
      When updating the positions of the particles, we used numerical integration to estimate the position and velocity at the next timestep. Initially, we used Forward Euler, a first-order, explicit numerical integrator, to test if our system could run with a few particles. The Forward Euler update rule is defined as such: 
      <div style="text-align:center">
        $x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t \Delta t$ <br>
        $v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t \Delta t$
      </div>
      However, this led to our particles exhibiting very unstable behavior, and it was especially noticible when the particles would have large accelerations from getting too close to massive particles or after a short period of time, all particles would fly off to infinity. This was to be expected, as Forward Euler is numerically unstable, leading to catastrophic errors building up over time. Upon doing further research we found and referenced a paper called "N-Body simulations of gravitational dynamics" - Walter Dehnen and Justin I. Read, where they discussed different integration methods. We chose "Kick-Drift-Kick" Leapfrog Integration, which is second order 
    </p>
    <h3 align="middle">Improving Performance: Barnes-Hut</h3>
    <p>
      In order to compute the net force on each particle, we initially ran a quadratic algorithm to compute the pairwise force between all the particles. As one might imagine, for large number of particles (1000+) our simulation begins to significantly slow down. The primary optimization approach we took was to adopt the Barnes-Hut algorithm. This algorithm allowed us to reduce the runtime to compute forces on the particles from $O(N^2)$ to $O(NlogN)$. There are two phases to this algorithm: (1) building the octree out of the particles, and (2) computing the forces on each particle using the octree. We will refer to the octree in Barnes-Hut as a BHTree from now on.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a BHTree, only the external nodes contain either a single particle or no particles. The internal nodes on the other hand contain no particles but store the center of mass as well as the total mass of all the particles contained within its subtree. When computing the net force on a particle, if the center of mass of the octant the particle is sufficiently far, then we approximate all of the particles in that octant as a single particle such that its total mass is equal to the sum of all the masses of the particles in it. Below is the condition that determines whether or not the center of mass of an octant is sufficiently far:
    </p>
    <div style="text-align:center">
      $d > L / \theta + \delta$ <br>
    </div>
    <p>Where $d$ is the distance between the particle and the center of mass of the octant, $L$ is the length of the diagonal of the octant's bounding box, $\delta$ is the distance between the octant's geometric center and the its center of mass. Finally, $\theta$ is a parameter we chose that essentially dictates the "leniency" of the approximation. Low $\theta$ values increase the accuracy of the force computations but slow the algorithm down ($\theta = 0$ is equivalent to naive), and high $\theta$ values decrease the accuracy of the force computations but speed up the algorithm (more approximations occur). After some tuning, we decided to use $\theta = 0.7$.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Improving Usability: Particle Generation and GUI</h3>
    <p>
      Once the simulation logic was implemented, we wanted an easy way to create interesting simulations. For example, we have simulations for a single galaxy, two galaxies colliding, a particle cloud with no central star, and more. Each simulation has a button in the GUI that you can click to switch between. To start playing the simulation press 'P' and press 'P' again to pause it. To restart the simulation or update any changed configurations, press 'R'. There is also a button that toggles a feature to randomize the masses of the particles
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, we actually struggled with creating "space-like" simulations because of the fact that when a simulation starts, particles would simply be attracted directly towards the center star instead of orbiting it. To address this, we gave each particle an initial tangential velocity, and this was sufficient to allow particles to orbit in a more realistic fashion.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Improving Visuals: Shaders</h3>
      <p>
        During our research, we wanted to find different rendering models compared to those we've seen in lecture. 
        This is how we stumbled upon the Cook-Torrance model. The Cook-Torrance model is a microfacet model used
        for simulating the appearnce of rough surfaces. It uses a combination of the surface roughness and the surface
        reflectance to calculate its appearance. It is widely used to simulate metals, plastics, and ceramics, but 
        we thought it would be itneresting to try to implement.
